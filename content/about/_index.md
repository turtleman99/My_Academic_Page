I am Guangyuan Weng (<font face=STKaiti>翁光源</font>), a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Northeastern University][1]. 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Esteban Moro][8].
My research interest lies broadly in computational social science, data mining, and deep learning.
I am particularly fascinated by the intricate relationship between human mobility and urban social fabric. 
Previously, my focus was on advancing long-tail image recognition and enhancing visual reasoning through representation learning.


Prior to Northeastern, I gained valuable experience as a research intern at the [IU Computer Vision Lab][3] under the mentorship of [Prof. David J. Crandall][4]. 
Before that, I worked with [Prof. Sören Schwertfeger][5] as a research assistant at [The Mobile Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab][6]. 
My academic roots trace back to [ShanghaiTech University][7], where I completed my B.E. degree in July 2021.
