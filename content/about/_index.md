I am Guangyuan Weng (<font face=STKaiti>翁光源</font>), a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Northeastern University][1], advised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang][2]. My research interest lies broadly in computer vision, including compositional reasoning and egocentric vision. I work on metric and representation learning for visual reasoning, enhancing the vision model with inductive capability.


Before joining Northeastern University, I was a research intern in [IU Computer Vision Lab][3], supervised by [Prof. David J. Crandall][4]. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Sören Schwertfeger][5] as a research assistant at [The Mobile Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab][6]. I obtained my B.E. degree from [ShanghaiTech University][7] in July 2021.
